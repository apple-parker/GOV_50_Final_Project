## Project thoughts

I am interested in election analytics and data journalism. Last fall, I took a journalism class where I reported on Utah's 2022 Senate race. I think it would be interesting to analyze this same election using the quantitative data analysis methods we are learning in GOV 50. I'd like to see what new insights I gain when approaching this election from a quantitative vs. a qualitative point of view.
